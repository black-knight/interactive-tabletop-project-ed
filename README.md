Interactive Tabletop Project:ed is a framework for creating interactive, digital tabletop projects, focusing mainly on board games played with physical bricks. It thus combines interaction between physical bricks and a digital board projected from a mini projector connected to an iPhone.

Interactive Tabletop Project:ed is a framework which enables you to create iPhone apps which - when run on an actual phone connected to a simple projector setup - creates an interactive, digital tabletop board game playable on any table.

By monitoring the projected board game from the camera of the iPhone, the framework recognizes the board state by detecting the positions of the physical bricks. By interacting with the bricks the state changes and the board game is capable of evolving according to this new state.

The setup

What you need in order to get started:

* An iPhone (>= 5?)
* A mini projector (not pico, as the resolution should be at least 1280x800, and - depending on the setup - low weight)
* A Lightning to VGA adapter to connect the iPhone to the projector
* A camera stand with a cross bar/boom
* Bricks with black feet (see photos below)
* A table :-)

Getting started
---------------

Simple enough:

Install one of the sample apps, plug in the projector and the iPhone in the stand; connect the iPhone to the projector and start the app. The app will now recognize the game board on the table and the game will begin.

Alternatively, you can simply run the app from the iPhone simulator and click any piece on the board to simulate a brick placement.

Current state
-------------

The following features have been implemented:

* Board recognition
* Brick recognition
* Sample game: Interactive Tabletop Project:ed MAZE

What's up next?
---------------

* More stable board and brick recognition
* Simple geometric figure recognition, fx. triangles, stars, etc.
* Hand/finger recognition
* More samples
* Better/simpler setup

Photos are varying in quality. In particular, the maze is left completely white on some photos. On the actual table the image is, of course, perfectly clear.
